/**
 * Abstract class that provides properties and methods that are used as part of a 
 * mapping scheme to bind common JSP input values to a particular data source view 
 * document.  The functionality of AncestorQueryCriteria is designed to be used within 
 * an extended implementation of {@link AbstractActionhandler} where the client's 
 * input values can be mapped to a DataSource View document using one of two approaches: 
 *  <ol>
 *    <li>By bean introspection using one of the {@link DataSourceAdapter}.package* methods.</li> 
 *    <li>By manual means using custom logic to map the values.</li>
 *    <li>A combination of introspection and manual means.</li>
 *  </ol>
 * 
 * In order to map the client's input values using the first approach, a few client-side JSP 
 * design rules must be sataisfied for this class or any of its descendents to recognize one 
 * or more JSP input controls as a query field versus a common input field. 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Client JSP input control names, which are designated to contain selection criteria 
 * data, must be prefixed with the following string, "qry_", and the rest of the name must 
 * be that of one of the DataSource view property names which the first character following 
 * the prefix must be capitalized. For example, qry_XactId. 
 * </li>
 * <li>The root of the JSP input control name must match the spelling of it corresponding
 * DataSource View property name.
 * </li>
 * <li>If multiple instances of a given input control name are used to represent a
 * range of values, then the JSP is required to comply to this naming format:
 * 1) must be prefixed with the following string, "qry_", 2) the root part of the name must 
 * be that of one of the DataSource view property names which the first character following 
 * the prefix must be capitalized, and 3) the remaining portion of the name must have an 
 * underscore ("_") plus a numerical index value (1..n) appended. For example,
 * qry_XactId_0, qry_XactId_1.
 * </li>
 * <li>When appending an index to the name of a field, ensure that the index is
 * a number and do not use leading zeros.
 * </li>
 * <li>Values representing relational operators associated with a given
 * selection criteria field must be prefixed with the following: "qryRelOp_".
 * For example, qryRelOp_XactId. When a relational operator has been selected to
 * be associated with a field that is part of a multiple instance selection
 * criteria field, then the relational operator field must be named with the
 * same index that of is assoicated selection criteria field. For example,
 * qry_XactId_1 ==> qryRelOp_XactId_1.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * When the desire exists to ignore the introspection of one or more JSP query input controls 
 * so that a custom mapping implementation may be used, the following rule must be met:
 * ensure that the client JSP query input control name(s) do not conform to any of the 
 * property names that exist in this class or any of its descendents.
 * <p>
 * This implementation provides functionality for the following common external data 
 * fields: id, date_created, date_updated, and user_id.
