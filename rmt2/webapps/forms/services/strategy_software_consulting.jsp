	  <p><font class="blocktext">Problem identification and resolution is often a difficult task for busy executives.&nbsp;&nbsp;In many instances it is advantageous to have the assistance of a knowledgeable, unbiased <strong>software development company</strong> experienced in <strong>business software</strong> design.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1997, RMT2 Business Systems Corp. has helped numerous organizations identify and resolve complex business problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;RMT2 consultants have hands on experience in a wide variety of environments ranging from large automated warehouses to sophisticated customer contact centers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our <strong>software design</strong> and <strong>software development</strong> teams have years of experience in <strong>custom programming</strong> and<strong> application software development</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can help you identify and resolve problems with your business processes, information systems, or technology utilization.&nbsp;&nbsp;RMT2&acute;s consulting methodology includes, but is not limited to, the following tasks:</font></p>
      <p><font class="blocktext"><strong><font style="font-weight:bold">Define the problem:&nbsp;</font></strong>Businesses often treat symptoms instead of addressing the actual cause of a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, a high abandonment rate in the customer service contact center might be perceived as a shortage of personnel when the actual problem could be related to other factors such as poor system response, necessary information not readily available, incorrect information displayed or in wrong sequence, employees at fax machine, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience and focus allows us to zero in on the real issues causing the problem and our software consultants can recommend the appropriate business software solution.</font></p>
      <p><font class="blocktext"><strong><font style="font-weight:bold">Quantify the problem:&nbsp;</font></strong>Knowing the source of a business problem is not enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;Proper problem resolution requires an in depth understanding of the effects of the problem, either in terms of value (dollars) or opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Problem resolution decisions should always be based upon some tangible benefit such as increased profits, improved customer loyalty, or some other strategic objective.&nbsp;&nbsp;To accomplish this you will need a reasonable idea of the cost/value of the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;ISG has performed cost/benefit studies for many of its clients.</font></p>
      <p><font class="blocktext"><strong><font style="font-weight:bold">Identify a solution:&nbsp;</font></strong>After the nature and scope of the problem have been identified, it is time to evaluate and select a methodology for resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases the cost/benefits might outweigh the problem, in which case the decision will be easy: do nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases, however, this is where an experienced consultant can be most beneficial.&nbsp;&nbsp;RMT2 can assist you in the evaluation and selection of software solutions, technology and hardware solutions, and process enhancement strategies.&nbsp;&nbsp;RMT2â€™s broad based experienced allows us to identify which solutions will be most appropriate for your business problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;RMT2 can also assist with software design, custom software development, software integration, and custom web software development services.</font></p>
      <p><font class="blocktext"><strong><font style="font-weight:bold">Implement the solution:&nbsp;</font></strong>Change within an organization is never easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is often why the problem existed in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Custom business software solution implementation requires diligent, systematic management to succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Proper planning and precise timing are necessary to guarantee ongoing business operations during implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;RMT2 services such as project planning and management, design review, product acquisition, installation, testing, and training will help insure the success of your project.</font></p>
