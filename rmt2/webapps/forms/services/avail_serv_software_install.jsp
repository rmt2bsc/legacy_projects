      <p><font class="blocktext">We perform on-site installations of our software systems, and on-site integrations with clients' existing legacy, proprietary, custom, and off-the-shelf applications.													  
      During development, we review with clients each key module of the system at critical points on the development schedule.  After development is completed, we usually 
	  conduct two different on-site reviews and training sessions, which usually span two days.  We also integrate clients' existing software with our systems and perform 
	  our own on-site testing at these times.  Then, after an initial installation of the completed system, we conduct another on-site review and training session, which 
	  usually spans three days.  After this, clients conduct internal testing and compile information regarding any final required modifications and additions, we make the 
	  requested changes, then conduct another on-site review and training session for the updated system, which can also span up to three days.  After final testing by 
	  clients, we conduct a final on-site installation and training session which usually spans another three to five days.</font></p>

    <p><font class="blocktext">Our typical on-site training programs consist of personal and direct instruction with department managers in the beginning stages of development, and expand to other 
	system users as we approach initial installation and final installation.  Our primary goal is to make sure that all department managers are completely comfortable with 
	the operation and navigation of the system, so that they can effectively train their department members.  Additionally, we want to make sure that every user of the system 
	knows how to use the tools of the system effectively and completely.</font></p>

    <p><font class="blocktext">We provide one-on-one training sessions, department-wide training sessions, and even company-wide demonstrations to alert other members of the company of the new tools, 
	enhancements, and features of the new systems.  By the end of each training session, system users are able to effectively navigate the new system, enter, edit, delete, 
	retrieve, query, process, and output information that they have access rights to.  They are also able to answer questions from other department members about each module 
	and feature they have access to.  We want each system user to be able to effectively communicate what each component does, and how that component fits into the operation 
	of the overall system.</font></p>

    <p><font class="blocktext">We provide instructional outlines, operational demonstrations, and personal training for each user or group.  In addition, all code is documented for the client's IT 
	department reference, context-sensitive help and online help can be included in the software systems, and instruction manuals can be provided in both hardcopy and 
	electronic format.  Of course, we also provide technical support via phone, fax, email, web site, and remote administration.</font></p>
