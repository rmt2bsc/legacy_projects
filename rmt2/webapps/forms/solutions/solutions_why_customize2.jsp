	  <p><font class="blocktext">Our systems do not require proprietary hardware or networking equipment, and even though our software is "customized" for your 
	  company and is a "proprietary" solution for you,  the code and tools used to develop this software are not proprietary; the tools are standard, industry-leading software 
	  development tools, and the code is written using Microsoft standards and standard software engineering methods and protocols, 
	  so you are not locked into us as the only vendor who could maintain or support the systems.  With our custom-developed software, 
	  there are no annual upgrade costs; upgrades are driven directly by you, so you only pay for additions or enhancements that you 
	  specifically request.</font></p>
	  
      <p><font class="blocktext">There are no required support contract fees; you pay only for the actual time spent on support incidents, on a case-by-case basis 
	  at our standard rate.  Any of your suggestions for improvements, requests for enhancements, requirements for corrections to errors 
	  and other "bugs", and requirements for your growth and expansion are immediately dealt with; errors are corrected immediately at 
	  no charge, and any other additions, modifications, or enhancements are submitted back to you with detailed time and cost estimation, 
	  so that you can make the decision as to which modifications are feasible at that time.  Our solutions meet 100% of your needs, and 
	  are built to meet your future needs as well because we work with you to define these factors.  Finally, we combine all aspects of 
	  implementation into our project schedules, which provides efficient and effective development and deployment.  We design, develop, 
	  implement, install, integrate, test, and provide training for custom-defined, enterprise software systems in less time and usually 
	  at much lower cost than most other solutions including "canned" and previously-customized applications.</font></p>

      <p><font class="blocktext">All these factors equate to a lower total cost of ownership.  In fact, when considering "investment" costs, "recurring" costs, 
	  and "nonrecurring" costs, the latter two costs are virtually eliminated, unless directly driven by you</font></p>
