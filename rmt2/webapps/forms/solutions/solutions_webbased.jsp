      <p><font class="blocktext">Do you need custom Internet software to put your business on the world wide web? Are you looking for Internet accounting software 
	  or Internet business software  to improve your business? Can you reduce your operating costs or improve customer loyalty be 
	  expanding your services to the Internet? It's no secret that many successful companies depend on an Internet web site to improve 
	  their business performance by allowing customers to place orders, check their order status, and to perform any number of business 
	  transactions via the corporate web site.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your customers don't currently have web access to your organization then you are 
	  probably losing business to your competitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;An effective eCommerce solution can help you improve your business and retain your 
	  valuable customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;ISG can design and build high performance custom eCommerce software tailored to the exact needs of your 
	  business and your customers.</font></p>

     <p><font class="blocktext">Along with the development of software applications and eCommerce systems, RMT2 Business Systems Corp is pleased to provide you 
	 with web design services.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we start working on your web project, our goal is to make sure that the final result meets these three 
	 key objectives...</font></p>

     <p><font class="blocktext"><strong><font style="font-weight:bold">Appeals to the target audience</font>:&nbsp;</strong>You can create a bright flashy site 
	 with lots of animation and cool effects, however if your target audience is the financial industry, then it will not be attractive 
	 to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;And vice versa, a lot of numbers and facts won't appeal to the teenage crowd.&nbsp;&nbsp;They would appreciate a site that targets 
	 their emotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;So before starting the design process, we take time to <strong>analyze and understand your audience</strong>, 
	 their desires and motives.</font></p>

<p><font class="blocktext"><strong><font style="font-weight:bold">Easy To Use</font>:&nbsp;</strong>Usability is a crucial part of any software application or a 
web-site.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your customers are not able to determine what the purpose of the site is and how to use it in the first 5-10 seconds - they 
won't use it again.&nbsp;&nbsp;For our brains the speed we browse the internet is comparable to the speed of a car running on a highway.&nbsp;&nbsp;You only 
have a few moments to catch the meaning of a billboard on the side of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same rule applies to web-design.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your customer 
should <strong>immediately understand your offering</strong>, how to navigate the web-site and what the next step is.&nbsp;&nbsp;And our team 
will make sure that your site achieves these goals.</font></p> 													  

<p><font class="blocktext"><strong><font style="font-weight:bold">Effectiveness:</font>:&nbsp;</strong>You may have a beautiful web-site, appealing to your 
audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be extremely user-friendly and easy to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;However if it does not achieve its purpose - the site is useless.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are selling a product, your site should not lead your customers to a maze of information pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;It should get your visitor 
to the <strong>"Thank you for your order!"</strong> page.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you a running a restaurant business, then your web-site goal is to get the customer to 
call you to make a reservation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore your phone number should not be buried at the very bottom of the "Contact Us" page, but 
rather proudly displayed at the most prominent place on all pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;And when we design your site, we build it in a way that actually 
guides the customer to the desired point.</font></p>
