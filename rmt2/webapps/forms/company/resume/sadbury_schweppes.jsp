Served as an Programmer Analyst/Developer to analyze, design, and develop enhancements for Cadbury Schweppes targeting a 
web and client/server based Generic Pricing Sub-System of the National Accounts Information System (NAIS).&nbsp;&nbsp;  The objective 
was to enhance the system so that it takes on the responsibility of coordinating and communicating with bottlers from all 
bottling systems while maintaining system integrity and ensuring that all reports, promotion announcements, pricing and 
billings are system-driven and bottler specific to 1) bottler pricing, 2) promotional activity, 3) chain store listings by 
bottler and field alignments, 4) bottler program billing calculations, and 5) retail sales data reporting and analysis.

	    <div>
			Created data upload modules using <strong>Oracle PL/SQL</strong> packages, Oracle control files, and <strong>Unix scripting</strong> 
			which its functionality entailed loading Chain Market to Store and Vendor to Bottler relationships through an upload of either an 
			Excel file of Comma Separated Value (csv) formatted file.&nbsp;&nbsp;   This greatly expedited the job of updating the database with new pricing 
			information, which was initially performed by business information specialist who entered this data into the system via on-line 
			screens.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Database Administration tasks included creating the necessary tables and triggers in Oracle to complement the window. 
	    </div>
	</li>
	<li>
	    <div>
			Created a Chain Price Rules window designed to contain configurable pricing rules that allow the NAIS application to 
			drive the validations for pricing.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Primarily developed in <strong>Powerbuilder</strong> using window objects, datawinodw objects, 
			non-visual business objects, and <strong>Oracle PL/SQL</strong>
        </div>
	</li>	
	<li>
	    <div>
			Developed the Price Administration window used to key in pricing into the system and to provide new validations driven 
			by the Chain Price Rules screen described previously.&nbsp;&nbsp;    This screen was programmed primarily using <strong>Powerbuilder</strong> window, 
			datawindow, structure, non-visual, and visual objects.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Database Administration tasks included creating the necessary 
			tables and triggers in <strong>Oracle</strong> to complement the window. 
  	    </div>
	</li>
	<li>
	    <div>
			Created the Chain Price Collection Job Process Maintenance module that allows users to add and remove business clients 
			from the Price Collection Job ran as a nightly background process.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The front-end piece was developed using <strong>Java, JSP, 
			HTML, Java Beans, and JavaScript</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;    The back-end part was developed using </strong>Java Servlets, JDBC, Java Beans, Oracle, 
			PL/SQL, and Windows NT Command Scheduler and Windows NT Shell Command Scripting</strong>, and <strong>UNIX CRON</strong> Scheduler.&nbsp;&nbsp;   
			Database Administration tasks included creating the necessary tables and triggers in Oracle to complement the process. 
 	    </div>
	</li>		
	<li>
	    <div>
			Developed the Price Transmit module responsible for to extracting, formatting, and packaging the data from the chain 
			price collection process and subsequently, sending the packaged pricing data to the chain or client.&nbsp;&nbsp;   
			This was exclusively developed using <strong>Oracle, PL/SQL</strong> user-defined packages, functions, and procedures, 
			and <strong>UNIX</strong>.
	    </div>
	</li>
	<li>
	    <div>
			In charge of coordinating and performing application builds for User Acceptance Testing (UAT), assigning UAT issues to 
			the responsible development team member, and managing source control.

	    <div>
			I was part of the Design team and Developer Team responsible for reengineering the pricing module.   During the design 
			phase, I devised moderately complex functional specifications which detailed  business logic, validations, and database 
			schema expectations for various modules of the pricing system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, all powerbuilder GUI's, Database objects, and 
			Object Oriented classed where documented using UML.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tools used to perform all of the above were Microsoft Word 
			and Sybase PowerDesigner 9.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote and executed test conditions for routine or isolated programming changes, of 
			moderate complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The structure of the test procedure was in the form of  1) Step Description, 2) Step Action to 
			perform, and 3) Excpected results of the step action.&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally this was devise using Microsoft Word.
