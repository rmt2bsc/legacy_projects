Worked as a software engineer contractor to support the software needs of Health Markets insurance agents.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I assisted in rewriting 
the insurance quote tool which I was responsible for the design and development of an integrated data migration utility component.&nbsp;&nbsp;   
This utility is used to convert the agent's contacts and quotes from the previous version of the software.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Developed web services 
and web front-end components to automate and bridge the process of the submission, approval/denial, and acknowledgment of the insurance 
agent's client application between various business units.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Developed various reports in PDF format using various XML technologies to 
reflect contact and quote data.&nbsp;&nbsp; Abundant use of numerous Java design patterns were incorporated in all development efforts.
