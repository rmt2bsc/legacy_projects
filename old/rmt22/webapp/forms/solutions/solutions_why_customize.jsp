      <p><font class="blocktext">There are usually many factors to consider when attempting to estimate the cost of ownership to implement a new software system.  
	  However, our solutions offer true financial benefits, especially when compared to other types of solutions, because we provide 
	  custom enterprise software development.  This type of development includes direct communication with you, detailed development 
	  schedules, efficient design, implementation, and testing methodologies and procedures, onsite installations, integrations, and 
	  training, extremely competitive rates, and low-cost support options.</font></p>
    
      <p><font class="blocktext">Offerings from other software suppliers may include "canned" software or other software that was customized for another company, 
	  which may or may not be very similar to your company.  These applications may meet some of your specific needs but will definitely 
	  require additional costly customizations, integrations, and possibly proprietary hardware, software, networking equipment, or 
	  interfaces.  Furthermore, there will usually be annual upgrade costs and required support contract fees.  Unfortunately, your 
	  suggestions for improvements, requests for enhancements, requirements for corrections to errors and other "bugs", and requirements 
	  for your growth and expansion are usually only "slated" for consideration in the next expensive "release" -- which can be six 
	  months to a year or more -- and may or may not be part of that release, depending on what other users of the same system have 
	  requested, or how "marketable" your suggestions will be to future users.  Even with canned or previously customized software that 
	  may somehow remarkably meet 75% of your needs initially, your custom implementation, training programs, and integration with 
	  existing hardware and software systems may take a year or more to complete.</font></p>													

      <p><font class="blocktext">With a custom-developed software system from our company, none of these factors apply.  We work directly with you to design 
	  systems that work exactly how you need them to work. We take into account your current business models, your desired changes 
	  to existing systems, your growth and expansion requirements, and your existing hardware and software systems and integration 
	  requirements, and we provide personalized, detailed, onsite instruction.</font></p>
