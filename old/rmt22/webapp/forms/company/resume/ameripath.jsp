Software engineer contractor contributing to the initiatives of the Data Integration team which primarily involved reworking the patient common billing web service architecture so that legacy ESB web service interfaces can be converted and migrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Assisted in troubleshooting data and business process execution issues as well as providing enhancements to existing patient order interfaces written in <strong>BPEL</strong>, <strong>XSL</strong>, <strong>XML</strong>, and <strong>Java</strong> as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I am expected to own and drive my assignments through all stages (business requirements, technical definition, development, testing, and, production support) to completion with high level of quality and within project timelines.
