Served as a Software Engineer Consultant to provide solutions to construct an avionic parts order management system (DOTCOM) 
used by numerous customers world wide over the web.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I was responsible for full life cycle object-orientated analysis, design 
and development of <strong>J2EE</strong> modules.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I also developed corporate level frameworks residing on top of various J2EE technologies to 
save developers from the rigors of dealing directly with J2EE APIs such as <strong>Servlet/JSP</strong>, <strong>JavaMail</strong> and <strong>JMS</strong>. 

<ul>
	<li>
	    <div>
		   Assisted in development of "Struts like" MVC framework which required implementing our own <strong>JSP custom 
		   tags</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The framework is currently being used in production within the Enterprise environment.

	</li>
	<li>
	    <div>
		   Developed a DOTCOM email system using JavaMail and Velocity templates to provide better developer experience in terms 
		   of iterfacing, gathering, and integrating data from external sources to produce and send email content to customers 
		   and internal users.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Another purpose of this API is achieve consistent look and feel of each email message 
		   produced by the DOTCOM site.
		</div>
	</li>	
	<li>
	    <div>
		   Developed  DOTCOM messaging system with <strong>JMS</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;  This messaging system further abstracted the implementation 
		   details of the underlying JMS API by encapsulating various messaging functionality into one place such as establishing 
		   a connection to the JMS provider, creating sessions, looking up destinations, creating consumer, producer and message 
		   instances, managing message properties and message selectors, creating and managing listeners, and configuring the messages 
		   for either synchronous or asynchronous delivery.
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	    <div>
		   Developed a DOTCOM-to-Siebel web service interface using the aforementioned JMS messaging system.&nbsp;&nbsp;  DOTCOM needed a 
		   mechanism for sending messages to and receive messages from Siebel in order to keep both system synchronized.
		</div>
	</li>		
	<li>
	    <div>
		   Assisted in developing a DOTCOM-to-Lawson (COBOL) HTTP URL <strong>web service</strong> based interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The purpose of this 
		   interface is to establish dialog between DOTCOM and Lawson for price and availability information, quotes, orders, and etc. 
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	    <div>
