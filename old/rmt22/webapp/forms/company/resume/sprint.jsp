Worked as a Software Developer contractor to maintain and develop billing programs under Sprint's PCS division.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Designed 
and developed security policies using Oracle's fine grain access control features to control and determine, at the level of the 
database, the access privileges for different groups of users querying the database for sensitive billing data.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Technically, Stored Procedures, Stored Functions, triggers, and Java Stored Procedures were used to dynamically attach, at runtime, 
a predicate (where clause) to any and all queries issued against a database table or view in regards to the user's request.
