Software engineer contractor contributing to the data integration based initiatives of the Travel Network Division of Sabre Web Services group.&nbsp;&nbsp;  My primary duties involved providing <strong>Core Java</strong>, <strong>SOAP</strong> based <strong>Web Services</strong>, and database integration enhancements and support for the Web Services infrastructure in regards to Travel/Booking.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Also took on various other projects within Sabre such as 1) developing and executing a plan to migrate legacy customer profile data to Sabre’s  new PowerPlus Profiles system under the auspices of web services, 2) refactoring of <strong>XML</strong> binding API’s, and 3) refactoring of exception handling logic.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I am expected to own and drive my assignments through all stages (business requirements, technical definition, development, testing, and, production support) to completion with high level of quality and within project timelines.
